## Tech Stack
- `Nuxt`
- `Netlify` for deploys, blob storage, image optimisations (using Nuxt Image under the hood)
- `Kinde` for Authentication
- `Supabase` for file storage



## Platform Primitives
Leveraged Netlify blobs as a database, used it to store user entries and moods.

`entries_uid`: Every diary entry is assigned a unique identifier (entries_uid), which helps in efficiently storing and retrieving the diary entries from the blob storage. This UID not only ensures the integrity of the data but also facilitates easy access and management.

`moods_uid`: Each mood entry is similarly tagged with a unique identifier (moods_uid), allowing the Mood Tracker feature to quickly aggregate and analyze mood data over time.
